# Art-for-a-Change-Plantshop
We are recording a remote playlist 'Harmony for Earth' that brings together musicians who are passionate about creating positive change. 

Learning React to be able to sell our music online at 5 euros per .mp3 and fund our marketing for eco conscious and art awareness program through our online community @lexaholism and @harmonyforearth, visit: songsfornature.wordpress.com for more information on how you can join our mission!

Okay I just thought up okay?? We are making a shop called 'Art for a Change Plantshop' People will be buying trees to plant for .mp3 downloads of the tracks from 'Harmony for Earth' each artist who participates also gets compensated but half of the money goes to setting up plants in big cityes where it is getting hot right now.

People will be choosing the plant they want to donate in the cart along with the song of their choice in .mp3

It needs to have 4 pages:
1. Welcome: Explain the cause in very simple words, black and white the text is huge and the logo of all the brands. Black background. Everything else white, earth picture.
Button: Plant a tree now

2. Plant a tree: Shopping cart that offers options for plants to donate at 5 euros each (9 options to add to cart)
Button: Choose your track

3. Choose your track: Option of all tracks from @ lexaholism with album art and .mp3 with a preview from youtube attached (only 1 track per purchase / only 1 track every purchase)
Button: Check out

4. Check out: Payment option paypal or googlepay
